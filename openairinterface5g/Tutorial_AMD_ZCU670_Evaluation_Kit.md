# Configuration and Usage Guide: Interfacing the AMD Zynq™ UltraScale+™ RFSoC DFE ZCU670 Evaluation Kit Target Reference Design (TRD) with OAI
This document provides a step-by-step guide for configuring and interfacing the AMD Zynq™ UltraScale+™ RFSoC DFE ZCU670 Evaluation Kit TRD with the OAI gNB stack. The ultimate objective of this deployment is to establish end-to-end network connectivity with a Commercial Off-The-Shelf User Equipment (COTS UE), using the ZCU670 evaluation board as a Cat-A O-RU.

Target Specifications:
- ZCU670 evaluation board as a 4x4 Cat-A O-RU 
- Channel Bandwidth: 100 MHz, Single Component Carrier, numerology 1
- Operating Frequency: Band n77, 3.9504 GHz center frequency
- FPGA image: TRD prebuilt image (zcu670_rfsoc_dfe4x2111p1222bw983_fcmcd_emcp_oran1z_agc_unif)

**NOTE**: AMD provides images for 2x2, 4x4, and 8x8 configurations. While this guide focuses on the 4x4 setup, the procedures described apply to the other configurations as well.

# 1. Evaluation kit Setup

![ZCU670](images/kit.png)

The primary I/O interfaces used in this tutorial are:
- 1x SFP28 for 25G Ethernet connection to DU
- USB (JTAG/UART) for Fronthaul and DFE chain configuration
- MicroSD Card for System boot image
- User 4-pole DIP switch for selecting the System boot through the MicroSD Card
- XM755 Breakout board for RF interfacing 

## 1.1 Setting up the XM755
The XM755 RFMC 2.0 is a specialized daughtercard bundled with the AMD Zynq™ UltraScale+™ RFSoC DFE ZCU670 Evaluation Kit: https://www.amd.com/en/products/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/evaluation-boards/zcu670.html

The module acts as an RF breakout board, routing the internal DAC and ADC channels to external SMA connectors. This enables direct interfacing with RF instrumentation, external power amplifiers, or standard laboratory test equipment.

The 4x4 TRD design uses the 4 DACs of the first tile (DAC_T0_CH0, DAC_T0_CH1, DAC_T0_CH2, DAC_T0_CH3), that are mapped to JHC1 in the XM755. And the 4 ADCs of the first tile (ADC_T0_CH0, ADC_T0_CH1, ADC_T0_CH2, ADC_T0_CH3), that are mapped to JHC5.

**NOTE**: On the 2x2 TRD, DAC_T0_CH0, DAC_T0_CH1, ADC_T0_CH0, ADC_T0_CH1 are used

The baluns used for the 1-4 GHz range are: Anaren BD1631J50100AHF  
The baluns used for the 4-5 GHz range are: Anaren BD3150N50100AHF  
For a 4x4 configuration, we opted for the **3.9 GHz to 4 GHz** range.  

Connect the two Carlisle Core HC2 8 Channel cables to the JHC1 and JHC5 headers as illustrated below:

![XM755_1](images/XM755_1.png)

**NOTE**: This tutorial focuses strictly on the interfacing between the TRD and OAI. Because RF performance optimization (i.e. amplification and filtering) is outside the scope of this guide, the RF front-end is bypassed.

The remaining ports circled in yellow will be connected to either 8 antennas (4 TX on the left, and 4 RX on the right) or 4 antennas + 4 circulators.

In our case we are working with **4 antennas and 4 ciruclators**:

![XM755_4](images/XM755_2.png)


## 1.2 Setting up the Quad zSFP connector 
The ZCU670 evaluation board features an integrated quad zSFP/zSFP+ connector cage supporting an aggregate throughput of up to 100 Gbps. For this deployment, fronthaul communication is established over a single 25 Gbps interface (eth0).

The physical ports are housed within a unified 2x2 zSFP cage assembly. Activating and routing data through a specific Ethernet interface requires the manual placement of hardware jumpers on the designated configuration pins surrounding the cage. Refer to the layout below to install the jumper corresponding to the target 25 Gbps port:

![eth](images/eth.png)

## 1.3 Boot images
The prebuilt boot images for the TRD are available on the DFE lounge (Zynq RFSoC DFE Advance Tools Access Secure Site), inside ug1530-zynq-rfsoc-dfe-trd-product-archive-v2-3.zip  
It is possible to boot the system through JTAG or SD card. In this tutorial we are going to use the **SD card** method:  
Creating an SD card for system boot can be done directly by inserting the Micro SD card into a PC, formatting if necessary, and then directly copying the BOOT.BIN, image.ub, and boot.scr files to the primary FAT-32 partition on the SD card.

BOOT.BIN, image.ub, and boot.scr files are located inside
ug1530-zynq-rfsoc-dfe-trd-product-archive-v2-3/sd_products/zcu670_rfsoc_dfe4x2111p1222bw983_fcmcd_emcp_oran1z_agc_unif


## 1.4 System Boot Switch Configuration
The System boot switch must be configured accordingly to the system boot mode (JTAG on the left or SD card on the right)

Once the Power switch is on, after a few seconds, the LED circled in light blue will turn green if the system boot is successful.

# 2. RU configuration

In this tutorial, the Fronthaul and DFE chain is configured through the Menu application (Menu.py). Other options are available, for example the M-plane server.

Serial console access to the target is established via the USB (JTAG/UART) interface:

```
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200
```

During the system boot up, wait for the ` python3[605]: CRITITCAL ERROR: Unable to Run Pyro Server ` line to appear:

<details>

Then type the following:

```
petalinux
```
and insert the password: plnx

then:
```
sudo systemctl stop raft-startup.service
```
and insert the password: plnx

Now we can change the ethernet configuration:
```
sudo vi /usr/share/middleware/command_files/fh_eth_config.txt
```

As previously stated, we are going to use eth0, so we are going to substitute Fronthaul Ethernet Port 0 Configuration with ours:
```
# Fronthaul Ethernet Port 0 Configuration
set dest_mac_addr 0 00:11:22:33:44:68     # gNB MAC addr
set src_mac_addr 0 00:0a:35:1d:00:38    # ZCU670 evaluation board MAC addr
set vlan 0 13 0 0     # setting up VLAN port 13
```
We are also going to set up the mtu size to 9000:

```
# Set Framer MTU
set mtu_size 9000
```

It is also possible to modify the U-plane/C-plane timing of the O-RU:
```
sudo vi /usr/share/middleware/command_files/fh_delay_profile_config_ant4.txt
```
Where:

**set dl_timing_params <cc> <delay_comp_cp> <delay_comp_up> <advance>**  
- cc: Component carrier to configure  
- delay_comp_cp: Delay compensation for C-Plane (in microseconds) = size of the valid reception window for C-Plane packets, and is equivalent to (i.e. T2A_MAX_CP_DL - T2A_MIN_CP_DL)  
- delay_comp_up: Delay compensation for U-Plane (in microseconds) = size of the valid reception window for U-Plane packets, and is equivalent to (i.e. T2A_MAX_UP - T2A_MIN_UP)  
- advance: Control time advance (in microseconds) (i.e. TCP_ADV_DL)  


**set ul_timing_params <cc> <delay_comp_cp> <advance> <radio_ch_delay>**  
- cc: Component carrier to configure  
- delay_comp_cp: Delay compensation for C-Plane (in microseconds) = size of the valid reception window for C-Plane packets, and is equivalent to (i.e. T2A_MAX_CP_UL - T2A_MIN_CP_UL)  
- advance: Control time advance (in microseconds) (i.e. T2A_MIN_CP_UL)  
- radio_ch_delay: Total delay from output of FH to "air" (in microseconds) = time offset between the 10ms strobe and the actual "air" strobe; it compensates for the system delay for beam-former, DFE, etc.  


For this tutorial, the following parameters have been used:
```
set dl_timing_params 0 30 270 0
set ul_timing_params 0 800 0 123
```

**NOTE**: These parametrs depend on the configuration of the ORAN IP core, as well as the rest of the DFE chain, so particular care must be taken when changing the U-plane/C-plane timing parameters. In the case where not all packets are recived on time by the O-RU, it is therefore suggested to first try to modify the T1a and Ta4 values inside the gnb.conf file, rather than changing the ul_timing_params and dl_timing_params.

Finally, we need to configure the center frequency of the channel, in our case we will set it to 3.9504 GHz:

```
sudo vi /usr/share/middleware/manifest/design_manifest.json
```
And, inside the RFDC settings, insert:

```
"tx_freq_mhz": 3950.400,
"rx_freq_mhz": 3950.400,
```

Now we are ready to open the Applicaion Menu:

```
sudo systemctl start menu-app-startup.service
```

```
sudo menu.py
```

Running the Menu App does the following:
- Set up the Si5381 clocking
- Start the Pyro Server for ORAN and DFE IPs
- Start the PTP

Here is how the Menu App interface should look like for the **4x4 configuration**:

```

After that, we can configure the board for 1 Component Carrier, numerology 1, 100 MHz channel BW, BFP9 compression, by selecting `'10'` in the menu


# 3. gNB configuration

The OAI configuration file [`gnb.sa.band77.273prb.fhi72.4x4-zcu670EvalBoard.conf`](https://github.com/duranta-project/openairinterface5g/blob/develop/targets/PROJECTS/GENERIC-NR-5GC/CONF/gnb.sa.band77.273prb.fhi72.4x4-zcu670EvalBoard.conf) corresponds to:
- TDD pattern `DDDSU`, 2.5ms
- Bandwidth 100MHz
- MTU 9000
- 4TX4R
- center frequency 3.9504 GHz
- eAxC_offset 8, consistent with the Port configuration of the O-RU in /usr/share/middleware/command_files/fh_eth_config.txt
- no phase compensation (handled by the DFE OFDM block)


# 4. The full setup

![setup](images/full_setup.png)

The setup consists on:

- System hosting OAI gNB
- Falcon RX Fronthaul switch (LLS-C3 configuration)
- PC connected to the ZCU670 evaluation board through USB (JTAG/UART) to interact with the Menu Application
- ZCU670 evaluation board as O-RU
- XM755 + circulators + antennas as RF frontend
- Samsung S25 Ultra as a Commercial Off The Shelf User Equipment 

We are now ready to run the nr-softmodem from the build directory, and connect the UE to it.

```
cd ~/openairinterface5g/cmake_targets/ran_build/build
sudo ./nr-softmodem -O <configuration file> --thread-pool <list of non isolated cpus>
```

Details about the Core Network setup can be found [here](ttps://github.com/duranta-project/openairinterface5g/blob/develop/doc/NR_SA_Tutorial_OAI_CN5G.md).

## 4.1 Expected result on the O-RU's O-RAN counters
We can check the O-RAN counters by selecting `'2'` on the Menu app:

**NOTE**: A small offset between the PUSCH counters is observed in this setup. The offset remains stable over time, with no accumulating drift, and does not affect operation.
